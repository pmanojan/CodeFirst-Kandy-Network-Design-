Designed an imaginary network infrastructure for CodeFirst’s expansion to Kandy. The setup includes HSRP, BGP, OSPF, LACP, VTP, DHCP, and Syslog, ensuring a scalable and efficient network.

🚀 Building a Scalable Network Infrastructure for CodeFirst’s New Branch in Kandy! 🚀

Excited to share an imaginary network design scenario where I take on the role of a Trainee Network Administrator for CodeFirst, a growing software development company! 💻🔗

📍 Scenario:
CodeFirst, already established in Colombo, is expanding its operations by setting up a new branch in Kandy. With a team of professionals across various departments—Developers (20), Finance (10), HR (9), Sales & Marketing (12), Customer Support (14), Networking Team (14), and Servers (10)—the company needs a robust and scalable network.

📡 Network Deployment:
To meet their needs, the company has acquired an IP range of 10.254.1.0/24 and aims to implement advanced networking services, including:
✅ Syslog – Centralized logging for network monitoring
✅ DHCP – Dynamic IP assignment for efficient network management
✅ HSRP – High availability for gateway redundancy
✅ LACP – Link aggregation for improved bandwidth and fault tolerance
✅ BGP & OSPF Routing – Optimized inter-network and intra-network communication
✅ VTP – Simplified VLAN management

This scenario was a great opportunity to explore real-world network design principles, high-availability configurations, and enterprise-grade routing & switching protocols.
